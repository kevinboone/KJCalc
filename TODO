Parser limitation: load file -- modify parser to load whole files, 
rather than line-by-line

Implement separate display precision

Parse and display octal and binary

Completion requires at least one letter of the function/argument to be 
entered -- we can get a complete list of all possibilities, except at 
the start of the line.

Plotting is very crude

Note plots -- red, green, blue
