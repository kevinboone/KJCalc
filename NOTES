Commands: quit, exit
Variables: ans (deflt 0)

set
  mode -- raw, default, sci, eng, hex
    eng -- force to an exponent which is a multiple of 3, with prefixes for common values
    raw -- unprocessed output of the BigInteger->string conversion
Note that in all modes except "raw," trailing zeros and any trailing decimal
point are removed from decimal numbers.
     default -- sci when order > scibreak
     sci -- scientific always
     hex -- hexadecimal, unless number has a fraction, in which case default

  scibreak -- order of magnitude beyond which scientific notation will be used
    in default disp mode

  precision -- number of sig figs used in calculations (default 30)

Variables

twopi=2*pi
foo=bar=2


Defining functions
double:2*arg0

Arguments are numbered arg0, arg1, etc. There is no way for a function to
reject calls with the wrong number of arguments -- a run-time error will
be raised if the function uses and argN variable that was never supplied.
These argument variables are local to the function -- no symbols are defined.
