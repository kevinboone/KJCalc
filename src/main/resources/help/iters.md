**iters

The variable `iters` holds the maximum number of iterations that will be 
used by methods that attempt to find roots by iterative methods. 
The default value of `iters` is 100, but for high precision
(very small values of `eps`) this may be insufficient. 

See also: `eps`, `solve__secant`, `solve__bisection`.
