**e

The variable `e` holds the number 2.71828... that represents the base
of the natural logarithm. `e` _is_ a variable, not a constant, because
it is an irrational number, whose value cannot be represented exactly in
a number of any precision. Consequently, it has to be re-evaluated every
time the `precision` variable changes. The value can be overwritten
by the user, if required.

See also: `precision`.
