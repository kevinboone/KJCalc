**Names in KJCalc

Names of functions and variables can be of any length, and must
begin either with a letter character or an underscore (__). 
Other than the first character, names may also contain digits.
However, names cannot contain punctuation symbols, or symbols that
represent operators. What constitutes a letter might possibly vary
between platforms.

It is possible to create both a function and a variable with the same name:
there is no ambiguity since a function call will be followed
by an open parenthesis. 

The names of built-in functions and variables can be reassigned, 
and no warning will be given when doing so.

See also: `functions`, `variables`.
