**angle(a)

Set the current angle mode to _a_. `angle(deg)` sets 
it to degrees (the default),
while `angle(rad)` sets it to radians. This setting affects all
trigonometric functions. The angle mode affects
the way that future calculations are performed, not just the way in which
results are displayed.
